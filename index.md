## Course Description
Evolutionary biology is unique in the biological sciences because it is, to a large extent, a historical discipline. The history of life on earth unfolds over thousands to millions of years – a timescale not particularly amenable to experimental manipulation or direct study. In the absence of paleontological data, which are sparse for many taxa, one of the best resources we have for studying evolutionary history over very long timescales is phylogenetic biology.  

In the first part of this course, students will survey the theory and application of modern phylogeny inferences. Modern phylogenetic biology, however, consists of much more than the mere estimation of evolutionary trees. Phylogenies are now used to investigate an enormous range of evolutionary questions. For instance, biologists have used phylogenies to ask questions about the tempo of species diversification or extinction; about the evolutionary processes that govern phenotypic changes in organisms through time; and about the characteristics of the long extinct ancestors of living species.  

In the second part of this course, students will learn the important theory and practical methods of phylogenetic comparative biology – the use of inferred trees in evolutionary inferences.

## Accommodations
UMass Boston is committed to creating learning environments that are inclusive and accessible. If you have a personal circumstance that will impact your learning and performance in this class, please let me know as soon as possible, so we can discuss the best ways to meet your needs and the requirements of the course. If you have a documented disability, or would like guidance about navigating support services, contact the Ross Center for Disability Services by email ([ross.center@umb.edu](mailto:ross.center@umb.edu)), phone (617-287-7430), or in person (Campus Center, UL Room 211). To receive accommodations, students must be registered with the Ross Center and must request accommodations each semester that they are in attendance at UMass Boston. For more information visit: [https://www.umb.edu/academics/seas/disability-services/](https://www.umb.edu/academics/seas/disability-services/). Please note that the Ross Center will provide a letter for your instructor with information about your accommodation only and not about your specific disability.

## Academic Integrity and Student Code of Conduct
Education at UMass Boston is sustained by academic integrity. Academic integrity requires that all members of the campus community are honest, trustworthy, responsible, respectful, and fair in academic work at the university. As part of being educated here, students learn, exercise, increase, and uphold academic integrity. Academic integrity is essential within all classrooms, in the many spaces where academic work is carried out by all members of the UMass Boston community, and in our local and global communities where the value of this education fulfills its role as a public good. Students are expected to adhere to the Student Code of Conduct, including policies about academic integrity, delineated in the University of Massachusetts Boston Graduate Studies Bulletin, Undergraduate Catalog, and relevant program student handbook(s), linked at www.umb.edu/academics/academic_integrity.

---

## Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools
AI is allowed with attribution: Use of AI tools, including ChatGPT, is permitted in this course on certain assignments, as outlined in class. To adhere to our scholarly values and to the Student Code of Conduct, students must cite any AI-generated material that informed their work; citations should include not 7 only in-text citations and listing in the references, but also the full text of cited ChatGPT (or other Large Language Model (LLM) generator) as an appendix to the assignment. Using an AI tool to generate content without proper attribution qualifies as academic dishonesty. Students are also responsible for making sure that any AI generated text does not contain false or erroneous information. If students are unsure about whether or not a source is appropriate to use in the assignment, they should contact the instructor.
